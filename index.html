            Who Is Jabba the Hutt? 
        </h2>
        <p> Jabba the Hutt is a hideous crime lord from Star Wars. He paid for Han Solo to be frozen in carbonite (proving that money is better than a blaster), and owned a fabulous palace on Tatooine.  </p> <h2>
            Why Should I Adopt One?
        </h2>
        <p> After the Jabba the Hutt was choked by Leia Organeo (pun intended), Jabba the Hutts are feeling insecure without their palaces. Many need a  loving, caring family to live the rest of their lives with. </p>
        <h2>
            Thank you!
        </h2>
        <p> Not many people even consider adopting a Jabba the Hutt, so thank you for even considering taking in one of these crime lords into your home. </p>

Next, ensure that your Jabba the Hutt always has a stock of frogs/fish/slug thingies. Dont tell him not to do anything. Dont tell him he has to wear a mask because of a pandemic. Make sure that Salicious Crumb is always nearby to make Jabba laugh. Dont tell him to eat dry, dog food. Dont tell him to put on clothes. Dont tell him to do his homework. Dont tell him that hes a slug. Dont tell him hes not famous throughout the world. Dont tell him that people dont like slugs. Dont tell him that people step/smush/slap slugs. Dont tell him that his favorite team lost the Super Bowl. Dont tell him that youre not telling him stuff to keep him peacable and not causing collateral damage. Dont tell him to drink more water. Dont tell him to get outside more. Dont tell him that he is portrayed as a villian in Star Wars. Dont tell him that Leia Skywalker ###### ### (this portion has been edited so that Jabba the Hutt doesnt destroy the world in rage). Dont tell him that youve disabled him viewing his own likes, because they are... dismal. Dont tell him that most people do not consider Jabba the Hutt when deciding where to donate fresh, juicy frogs to. Dont show him these guidelines.</p><h2> How to Aquire Your Jabba the Hutts Palace Through Tax Claims:</h2><p> Have you ever wanted Jabba the Hutts palace? Well, you can claim its possession when Jabba the Hutt attemptes to hijack your finaces by relying on your money to eat his frogs. Allow him to eat your frogs for 90 days before filing your taxes, and then file a JTH Palace Possesion claim to take over Jabba the Hutts Palace. All assests are in your possesion, and all droids are to be set free. If he attempts to sue you, relinquish him from pethood, and he will not be able to sue you. You can also file JTH Palace Destruction without Proper Notification to destroy his palace without the Essensitial Jabba the Hutt Services department notifying your Jabba the Hutt. </p><h2>Hutt-proofing 101:</h2><p> When introducting a Jabba the Hutt to your home, dont show him where the frogs and/or candy is.</p><h2 id = "jabba-right?"> Is a Jabba The Hutt Right For You?</h2>If you like temper tantrums, the smell of disentegrating frogs, and constantly not telling your Jabba the Hutt general information about the world, then you will enjoy having a Jabba the Hutt.
